Objective: Build an offline-first dating app called "AccountaDate" that works without a backend server. The app must allow users to connect, chat, and end conversations respectfully. The entire app will store user data locally using SQLite, making it functional offline. It should have a playful, colorful, and user-friendly design suitable for all demographics. The app must handle registration, login, matching, chatting, and gamify accountability with badges.

Development Requirements
Framework and Tools
Use React Native with Expo for cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, and web).
Use SQLite for local storage.
Use React Navigation for navigation.
Use styled-components or CSS-in-JS for theming.
Keep the app offline-first; no server or backend is required.
Features and Functionalities
User Flow
Registration & Login:

Collect username, email, and password.
Validate inputs (e.g., strong passwords, valid email).
Store credentials in SQLite and log users in immediately.
Profile Setup:

Users upload a profile picture and add personal info (e.g., age, bio, interests).
Data is saved locally in SQLite.
Matching System:

Users swipe through potential matches.
Swipes are saved locally to prevent duplicates.
Matching logic is simple: mutual swipes create a "match."
Chat Functionality:

Users can message their matches.
Conversations are stored locally with timestamps.
Ending Conversations:

Users must provide a reason for ending conversations.
Reasons are saved in the database.
Gamification:

Users earn badges for respectful communication and other milestones.
Badges are displayed on their profile.
Design and UI Requirements
Theme
Playful and Inviting: Soft gradients (e.g., blue, pink, and orange).
Rounded buttons and cards for a friendly appearance.
Emoji-based icons for actions like swiping, chatting, and ending conversations.
Screens
Splash Screen:

Display the app logo and tagline: “Where Respectful Dating Starts.”
Use a simple fade-in animation.
Registration/Login Screen:

Input fields for username, email, and password.
Prominent “Sign Up” and “Log In” buttons.
Validation messages for incorrect input.
Profile Setup:

Option to upload a profile picture (stored locally as a file path).
Input fields for bio, interests, and age.
Match Screen:

Card stack for swiping (e.g., Tinder-style).
Buttons for "Like" and "Pass."
Chat Screen:

List of active conversations with profile pictures.
Chat interface for sending and receiving messages.
Badges and Stats:

Display earned badges in a grid.
Show stats like “Conversations Ended Respectfully: X.”
Development Process
1. Initialize the Project
Use Expo to create a new React Native project.
bash
Copy code
expo init AccountaDate
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install @react-navigation/native react-native-sqlite-storage styled-components react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
2. SQLite Setup
Configure SQLite to store all app data (users, matches, messages, badges).
Example database schema:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  username TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  password TEXT NOT NULL,
  bio TEXT,
  interests TEXT,
  profile_picture TEXT,
  badges TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE matches (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  user_id INTEGER,
  match_id INTEGER,
  status TEXT, -- active, ended
  reason TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (match_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE messages (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  match_id INTEGER,
  sender_id INTEGER,
  message TEXT,
  timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (match_id) REFERENCES matches(id)
);
3. Implement Registration and Login
Create RegisterScreen and LoginScreen components.
Use SQLite to store and validate user credentials.
4. Profile Setup
Create a ProfileSetupScreen for users to upload pictures and add personal details.
Use the file picker from Expo to handle local images.
5. Matching System
Implement a SwipeScreen with a Tinder-like card stack.
Save swipes and matches in SQLite.
6. Chat System
Create a ChatListScreen to list all active conversations.
Create a ChatScreen for sending and receiving messages.
7. Ending Conversations
Add a button in the chat screen to end conversations.
Require users to select or type a reason for ending the chat.
8. Gamification
Track user activities (e.g., “ended 10 chats respectfully”).
Display badges in a BadgesScreen.
Code Examples
Add User Registration
javascript
Copy code
const registerUser = (username, email, password) => {
  db.transaction(tx => {
    tx.executeSql(
      'INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
      [username, email, password],
      (_, result) => console.log('User registered:', result),
      (_, error) => console.log('Error registering user:', error)
    );
  });
};
Handle Match Creation
javascript
Copy code
const createMatch = (userId, matchId) => {
  db.transaction(tx => {
    tx.executeSql(
      'INSERT INTO matches (user_id, match_id, status) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
      [userId, matchId, 'active'],
      (_, result) => console.log('Match created:', result),
      (_, error) => console.log('Error creating match:', error)
    );
  });
};
End Conversation
javascript
Copy code
const endConversation = (matchId, reason) => {
  db.transaction(tx => {
    tx.executeSql(
      'UPDATE matches SET status = ?, reason = ? WHERE id = ?',
      ['ended', reason, matchId],
      (_, result) => console.log('Conversation ended:', result),
      (_, error) => console.log('Error ending conversation:', error)
    );
  });
};
Final Testing
Test all app features on iOS, Android, and web using Expo.
Ensure SQLite works correctly on all platforms.
Verify offline functionality by turning off Wi-Fi and testing the app.
Completion Checklist
 App is fully functional offline.
 Users can register, log in, and set up profiles.
 Matching, chatting, and ending conversations work seamlessly.
 Badges and gamification features are implemented.
 The UI is responsive, colorful, and user-friendly.
Once complete, export the app for Android, iOS, and web using Expo.
